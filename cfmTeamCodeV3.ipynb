    "After scoring our stocks, we will standardize the scores into z-scores. Unfortunately, z-scores can be negative and we wish to convert the z_scores into positive values. A simple approach is to use e^x. However, if x is decently large, e^x will become absurdly large. To fix this, we will use the softplus function, where softplus(x) = ln(1+e^x).\n",

    "The following assesses each remaining stock using four technical variables that are validated by research in finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is price momentum, which assesses whether or not a stock has shown long-run price power. This is just the current price, subtracted by the price 200 trading days ago. This has long been demonstrated to persistently outperform and outsmart investors via persistent capital inflows into winning assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is volatility, which is negatively weighted to favor companies that provide stable long-run stock market returns and risk-adjusted risk-returns. This volatility is only measured via the Standard Error Deviation daily treatment to ensure that excessive or abnormal price fluctuations are discouraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SMA-200 is calculated by averaging the past 200 daily closing prices, and it acts as a widely respected long-term trend filter in institutional trading. Firms that trade above this moving average are in healthy upward trends, whereas those priced below are generally experiencing long-term declines and are therefore excluded to avoid “value traps” that could continue falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth variable is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to evaluate whether an asset has become overbought. Its calculation involves computing daily price differences over a 14-day period and separating them into average gains and losses. These are used to form a ratio (RS), which is then converted into an index between 0 and 100. While values above 70 indicate an unsustainably strong buying surge, values between 30 and 70 signify a healthy, stable upward trend. By penalizing overly high RSI readings, the program prevents selecting assets at the peak of speculative buying phases where reversals are likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess how important each variable is, the program conducts thousands of simulation trials on  randomly generated weights. For each simulation trial, it generates a hypothetical portfolio and analyzes its performance based on its Sharpe Ratio, which documents the return on investment for every unit of volatility. This enables it to select the weighting pattern most suitable to the current market environment. The weights with the highest Sharpe ratio is then used to score and rank every stock. "
